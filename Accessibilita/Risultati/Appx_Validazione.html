      The element named above was found in a context where it is not allowed.

      One common cause for this error is the use of XHTML syntax in HTML

      beginning of the "body" section (where "link" and "meta" are not

      You have used a character that is not considered a "name character" in an
      attribute value. Which characters are considered "name characters" varies
      between the different document types, but a good rule of thumb is that
      unless the value contains <em>only</em> lower or upper case letters in the
      range a-z you must put quotation marks around the value. In fact, unless
      you have <em>extreme</em> file size requirements it is a very very good
      idea to <em>always</em> put quote marks around your attribute values. It
      is never wrong to do so, and very often it is absolutely necessary.

      You have used the attribute named above in your document, but the
      document type you are using does not support that attribute for this
      element. This error is often caused by incorrect use of the "Strict"
      document type with a document that uses frames (e.g. you must use
      the "Transitional" document type to get the "target" attribute), or
      by using vendor proprietary extensions such as "marginheight" (this
      is usually fixed by using CSS to achieve the desired effect instead).
    </p>
    <p>
      This error may also result if the element itself is not supported in
      the document type you are using, as an undefined element will have no
      supported attributes; in this case, see the element-undefined error
      message for further information.
    </p>
    <p>
      How to fix: check the spelling and case of the element and attribute, 
      (Remember XHTML is all lower-case) and/or 
      check that they are both allowed in the chosen document type, and/or
      use CSS instead of this attribute. If you received this error when using the

      An entity reference was found in the document, but there is no reference
      by that name defined. Often this is caused by misspelling the reference
      name, unencoded ampersands, or by leaving off the trailing semicolon (;).
      <strong>The most common cause of this error is unencoded ampersands in
      URLs</strong> as described by the <a
        href="http://www.htmlhelp.com/">WDG</a> in "<a
        href="http://www.htmlhelp.com/tools/validator/problems.html#amp">Ampersands
        in URLs</a>".
    </p>
    <p>
      Entity references start with an ampersand (&amp;) and end with a
      semicolon (;). If you want to use a literal ampersand in your document
      you must encode it as "&amp;amp;" (<em>even inside URLs!</em>). Be
      careful to end entity references with a semicolon or your entity
      reference may get interpreted in connection with the following text.
      Also keep in mind that named entity references are case-sensitive;
      &amp;Aelig; and &amp;aelig; are different characters.

      explanations and solutions to your problem.
    </p>
    <p>
      Note that in most documents, errors related to entity references will
      trigger up to 5 separate messages from the Validator. Usually these
      will all disappear when the original problem is fixed.
